# isettingkit
isettingkit is a modular UI toolkit designed to streamline the creation and management of business rule-driven interfaces. It offers a suite of reusable components, utilities, and type definitions to facilitate the development of dynamic, rule-based forms and configurations.

## 📁 Project Structure
The src directory is organized into the following primary modules:

### 1. businessRules
Contains components and utilities for managing business rules:

Cards/: Components like BusinessRuleCard for visual representation of individual rules.

Form/: Components such as RulesForm to create and edit business rules.

Modal/: Modal components for rule creation and editing workflows.

BusinessRuleView.tsx: A comprehensive view component to display business rules.

### 2. Filter
Provides components to filter and search through business rules:

FilterModal/: Modal components for applying filters.

FilterTag/: Tag components representing active filters.

FormFilter/: Form components to define filter criteria.

### 3. types
Defines TypeScript interfaces and types to ensure type safety across components:

businessRules/: Types related to business rule components.

Filter/: Types associated with filtering functionalities.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Installation
Install the package using npm:
``` bash
npm install @isettingkit/business-rules
```
Usage
Import and use the components in your project:
``` bash
import { BusinessRuleCard, RulesForm } from '@isettingkit/business-rules';
```
``` tsx
function App() {
return (
<div>
<BusinessRuleCard rule={ruleData} />
<RulesForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
</div>
);
}
```
## Theming
isettingkit utilizes styled-components for styling. Ensure your application is wrapped with a ThemeProvider and the appropriate theme is provided.

## 📚 Documentation
Each component is fully typed with TypeScript. Refer to the types directory for detailed type definitions:
